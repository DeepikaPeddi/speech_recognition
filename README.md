## This is one of my practical projects where I learned to work with pretrained ASR models and apply AI applications in real-world platforms. This project exposed me to Hugging Face Transformers, model deployment, and interface design with Gradio.A powerful transformer-based speech recognition model released by Facebook AI. It is trained on 960 hours of Librispeech data and can transcribe general English audio accurately.I used libraries like  Transformers (by Hugging Face) To access pretrained models and pipelines.Librosa -To load and preprocess audio files.Gradio-For creating the web interface to upload audio and display text output.Python-The entire backend is written in Python. I used Hugging Face Spaces to deploy the application live and allow users to interact with it from a browser. It supports Gradio apps and allows easy model hosting with GPU/CPU. This kind of speech-to-text system is extremely useful in a variety of domains like Education for Transcribing lectures, interviews, or classroom recordings, in Media & Journalism for Converting voice memos or field interviews into editable transcripts,in Accessibility for Helping individuals with hearing impairments by providing real-time text captions,in Call Centers for Automatically transcribing customer service calls for analysis,in Legal & Healthcare for Creating notes from voice dictation or recorded client sessions,in Content Creation for Turning spoken ideas into written blog posts, books, or articles. files incuded are app.py contains  Main Python file containing the app logic , requirements.txt has Required Python dependencies ,README.md for project documentation .Limitations are they Works best with English audio clips under 30â€“45 seconds , Only `.wav` format is supported for now , Long audio may cause performance issues on the free-tier Hugging Face runtime.I want to do  Future Improvements like adding support for multiple file formats (.mp3, .ogg),Allow longer audio by splitting it into chunks,Add speaker diarization (who spoke when),Support multilingual transcription using other models.
